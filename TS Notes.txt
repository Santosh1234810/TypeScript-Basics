data types in TypeScript
var num:number = 123;
var num:number = 123;

2. string
var myName:string = "Santosh";

3. boolean
var condi:boolean = true;

4. array
var fruits:string[]=["Apple","Mango","Strawberry","Kiwi"];
var boys:Array<String> = ["Vijay","Rahul","Rohit"];

5. tupple: it allows us to store multiple type of data array in array
var emp: [number,string,boolean] = [101,"Sanjay",true];

6. enum: it allows to create naming constant variable
enum days{sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat}
var first = days.mon;
consol.log(first);

7. union: it allows us to store multiple type of data in variable.
var z:string | number | boolean = 1520;

8. any: it allows to store all type of data in it.

var mix:any="hello";

*oops:
1. class: it is a collection of data-member and member function.
         -it is a template which we can reuse.
         -to create class we use class class keyword.

*this: it represent current class or object
*object: it is an instance of class.
        -it allows to access class data members.

*constructor: it is special member function of class.
            -it execute automatically when object of class initialize.
            -in ts class constructor name must constructor only.

*Inheritance: accessing parent class property into child class.
             -we extends child class with parent class by using extends keyword.

super(): it represents parent class constructor int child class constructor.
        -it must be first statement in child class constructor.

*Polymorphism: ability to take more than one form.

*Encaspulatin: wrapping of data into single unit.

*Abstraction: Hinding the unnecessary details and showing only essential information. 

1.public: by using this we can access data member outside and inside of class.
2.protected by using this we access class data member within same class and its child class but not outside class.
3.private: we can data member within same class only not in derive and not outside class.

*Module concept in ts:- here we can access data from one file to another file.
                      -

Task: create class with name product containing data member pid, pname, pPrice, brand and one function which will display all data.
